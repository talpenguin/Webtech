# Webtech
Project for Course "Webtechnologien" Wintersemester 18/19

In this Project we had to build a themed Website to one of the neighborhoods in Berlin.
For the implementation of the data we used (except for pure HTML) also templates and JSON files.
Next step was converting the website into a single-page-aplication with combination of Javascript (and jQuery)
in Order to Navigate between the different pages.
Last step was to run the Website on a local server.
